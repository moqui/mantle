It is based on Moqui Framework 1.3.2. This version covers procure to pay,
order to cash, and work plan to cash processes including:

- Purchase and Sales Orders (for goods, services, materials, etc; POs for
  inventory and equipment/supplies/etc)
- Project, Task, and Request management with time and expense recording,
  billable/payable rates by project/task/client/worker/etc
- Incoming and Outgoing Invoices with a wide variety of item types and an
  XSL:FO template for print or email

  project client time and expenses (AR), project vendor/worker time and
  expenses (AP)

  interfaces; applying payments to invoices
- Fulfillment of sales orders (including basic picking and packing) and
  receiving of purchase orders

orders (order to cash), and billable projects with client and vendor/worker
invoice/payment (work plan to cash).
